`Multihash <https://github.com/multiformats/multihash>`_ implementation in Python

Multihash is a protocol for differentiating outputs from various well-established cryptographic hash functions,
addressing size + encoding considerations.

It is useful to write applications that future-proof their use of hashes, and allow multiple hash functions to coexist.
See `jbenet/random-ideas#1 <https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues/1>`_ for a longer discussion.

Notes
=====

This package is a direct port of the official `Node/Javascript version <https://github.com/multiformats/js-multihash>`_.
As this projects matures, it may become more 'Pythonic'.

**Obsolete and deprecated hash functions are included** in this package. `MD4`, `MD5` and `SHA-1` should no longer be
used for cryptographic purposes, but since many such hashes already exist they are included in the multihash
specification and may be implemented in multihash libraries such as this one.
